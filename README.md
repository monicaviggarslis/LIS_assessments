This repository contains a notebook and related files for the Right Word assessment 2.

The notebook uses the OpenAI API. For security reasons, the API key is not included in this repository.

To run API-related code, create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following line:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

A sample file called `.env.example` is included to show the required format.  
The `.env` file itself should not be committed to GitHub.
